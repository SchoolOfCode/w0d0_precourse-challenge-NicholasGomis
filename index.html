                Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and
                chairman of Apple Computer. Under its leadership Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as
                dictating the evolution of modern technology.
                <br>
                <br>
                Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but
                directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve
                Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a
                decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.</p>

        <p id="quote">“Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the
        results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most
        important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” </p>
